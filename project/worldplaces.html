            <p class="fade2">This project was an online travel brand with the complimentary Twitter account
                @WorldPlaces. The purpose of this account was to grow an engaging audience interested in travel content,
                which was submitted by and shared tothe account's 350K total followers.
            </p>

            <p class="fade2">Starting this account was the first time I really felt like I was making a brand that people cared about.
                I found I learned a lot through simply giving exposure to travel content creators and I even worked on
                releasing simple merchandise as a separate project with one of the World Places logos, though the
                account was acquired in 2020 by a private media company before that could happen. Building the account
                allowed me to talk to and work with talented photographers and videographers, many of which were
                featured in photo and video tweets.
