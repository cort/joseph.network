            <h1>World Places</h1>

            <p>This project was an online travel brand with the complimentary Twitter account @WorldPlaces.
                The purpose of this account was to grow an engaging audience interested in travel content, which was submitted by and shared to
                the account's 350K total followers.
                <br><br>
                Starting this account was the first time I really felt like I was making a brand that people cared about. I found I learned a lot
                through simply giving exposure to travel content creators and I even considered releasing merchandise, though the account was sold
                in 2020.
